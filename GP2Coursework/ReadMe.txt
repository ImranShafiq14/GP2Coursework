P.S. The following techniques/tasks were implemented but do not work correctly, as a result, these
implementations were not committed to the master branch and are contained in seperate branches from the 
master/Coursework-Submission branches:
- Post Processing (contained in the 'PostProcessingTest' branch)
- Mesh Manager (contained in the 'MeshManagerTest' branch)


Each member contributed in finding and fixing bugs in each other's code.
